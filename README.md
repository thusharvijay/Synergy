## Project Details

### Overview
Our project is an educational fintech platform designed to help users learn about financial markets through live demo trading.

Additionally, it includes an expense tracker for financial management, Ethereum wallet integration for handling transactions, and a **real-time financial news aggregator** to keep users updated on market trends. With live market data, transaction details, and an interactive design, the platform enhances user engagement and offers hands-on financial learning experiences.
